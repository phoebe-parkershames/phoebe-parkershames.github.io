My name is Phoebe Parker-Shames and I am a graduate student in the [Brashares Lab](https://nature.berkeley.edu/BrasharesGroup/) at UC Berkeleyâ€™s [Environmental Science, Policy, & Management Department](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/). My work examines the role of humans within ecological systems, focusing on how land use change influences wildlife communities. My dissertation research is on the ecological outcomes of cannabis legalization.
