My name is Phoebe Parker-Shames and I am a graduate student in the [Brashares Lab] (https://nature.berkeley.edu/BrasharesGroup/) at UC Berkeleyâ€™s Environmental Science, Policy, & Management Department. My research examines the role of humans within ecological systems, focusing on how land use change influences wildlife communities.
